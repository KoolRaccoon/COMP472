This is the readme to the Mini-Project 1 of COMP472



There are 3 different files in the folder, one for DFS, one for BFS and one for A-Star

each one must be ran individually using the command-line

If you want to run let's say Best_First_Search.py, make sure that you open that file first and
in the delimited box at the top of the file, modify the "Max_Depth" you want the program to go
through, the Heuristic model either "1" for the Manhattan Distance model or "2" for the Sum of
Permutation model and finally the Size of the puzzle such as the number of Columns and Rows.

Once that is set, one must run the program from the command line and then the program will
prompt the user to input the puzzle he wants to run the algorithm on. an example will be given
for a 3X4 puzzle. The 0 represents the empty tile in the puzzle. 

Once the program has ran, it will output into a txt file specific to the algorithm and heuristic
specified. On the console you will also be able to see the final solution reached by the
algorithm as well as the depth it has found the solution. This is usually more practical if the
algorithm has not found the right solution but something close to it.

If a mistake was made when inputting the puzzle, the file must be compile again.

After each run, make sure you delete the txt files generated after run time, to get clean data
inside them.
