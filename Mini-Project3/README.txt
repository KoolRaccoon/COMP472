This is the readme of the project to explain how it works

there are there python scripts: Mini-Project3-unigram.py, Mini-Project3-unigram.py, Mini-Project3-unigram.py

each one runs its ngram model type and will try to predict the language of each sentence specified in the Sentences.txt

n_gram_models directory contains the models for each n-gram for all the languages in txt format
TrainingCorpuses contains the training material for each language
and finally the Outputs directory contains the probabilities predicited for each sentence
